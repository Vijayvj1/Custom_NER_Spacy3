Strengths of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for Indoor Localization in Asset Tracking:

Low Power Consumption: BLE devices are designed for energy efficiency, allowing them to operate for extended periods on a single battery charge. This is crucial for asset tracking applications where devices need to operate autonomously for long durations.

Proximity-based Accuracy: BLE is excellent for proximity-based applications, accurately detecting when a tracked asset is in close proximity to a BLE beacon. This is useful for scenarios like triggering an alert when an asset enters or exits a specific area.

Ease of Deployment: BLE beacons are compact and easy to install, requiring minimal setup effort. They can be strategically placed around the indoor environment, making them suitable for large areas without excessive infrastructure changes.

Increasing Device Adoption: Many modern smartphones, tablets, and IoT devices have built-in BLE capabilities, enabling easy integration with existing devices. This widespread adoption can simplify asset tracking implementation.

Reliable Indoor Coverage: BLE signals penetrate obstacles reasonably well, making them suitable for indoor environments with walls and obstacles that might impede other wireless technologies.

Weaknesses of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for Indoor Localization in Asset Tracking:

Limited Range: BLE has a limited communication range, typically around 10 to 30 meters. This can result in gaps in coverage or the need for a higher density of BLE beacons in larger spaces.

Signal Interference: BLE signals can be affected by signal interference from other wireless devices or obstacles. This can lead to inaccuracies in asset tracking and location estimation.

Accuracy at Scale: While BLE is accurate for proximity-based applications, its accuracy can decrease as the number of tracked assets increases. In crowded environments, maintaining consistent accuracy becomes challenging.

Vertical Positioning Challenges: BLE's accuracy in vertical positioning is limited, which can be problematic when trying to determine the exact floor level of an asset in multi-story buildings.

Initial Setup and Calibration: Implementing BLE asset tracking requires careful calibration and positioning of beacons to achieve accurate results. This initial setup effort can be time-consuming and may require ongoing maintenance.
